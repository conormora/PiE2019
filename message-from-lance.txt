Howdy!

Our goal is to have all of our code broken down into algorithm (step-by-step instructions) by the end of Thursday. 

The shield bot should have functions for:
- Drive forward
- Drive reverse
- Turn
- Open shield
- Close shield

The the forklift bot should have functions for controlling the lift. (Don't worry about the drivetrain controls -- I'll handle that.)

Don't worry about writing code. Write your pseudocode in Python comments.

When you're done for the day, commit your code to the Github repository. Leave a good description and commit to the MASTER branch.

Get what you can done.

Noodles,
Lance
